<p class="img_float">My work history is not what you would think of when you hear  of someone who is looking to go into the IT field. I am an intelligence analyst  by trade. I like being about to look at things and figure out what is wrong.  Though when it came to having to research and read long articles that was just  not for me. Then I found more about the IT world. I found out that I really  like how computers worked as well as how to fix them when they do not work. As  I am finding out coding is just one big puzzle. The list below describes my  past work history. </p>

    - For 6 years I was an All-Source Intelligence Analyst for  the U.S army. Where I performed a lot of different tasks. My main task was to  gather information about the mission we were currently on. The information  would be on anything my boss wanted to know about the area or people in that  area. I would research every database we had and then analyze the information  then brief my boss my findings.</li>
