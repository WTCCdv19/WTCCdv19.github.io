My Github account is a web based platform that is hosing my reposirories. This way I have all the codes I need in one place so it is easier to mange them. 
MY respository has all my code in one place that way if I was wokring on a team we would be able to edit the same code with out having to download and upload the code everytime someone made a change.
After downloading the software to my computer I ckicked the + button in the upper right hand corner. I clikced new repository. Name the repository then added all my files for my website. Then I placed the file in the desktop
