<p class="img_float">I created this web site to show off the skills I have  learned and developed over my experiences in not only my life but in my career.  I want to start early in my life with the skills and lessons I learn from  sports and from working out. Baseball since that was my main sport. I developed  the basic skills from sports. How to be part of a team. learn to deal with failure,  that arduous work beats talent, learned some leadership skills and how to  communicate. Even though I never realized it at the time learning these basic  skills would come into play when I got older and into my career. Let&rsquo;s fast forward  to I just got done with my second year of college and my baseball career came  to an end due to injury. Now lost and not knowing what to do. The only thing I  knew was that I did not want to be in school right now. Then I decided to join  the army in 2016. At the time I just wanted to get away from where I grew up  and do something. This will sound cliche, but this is where I found myself  again and a new purpose. I was scared this was the first time away from home  with no emergency exit plan. All the skills I learned from playing sports came  into play. Not only did they come into play, but I was able to develop them  even more. Over the next 8 years I have learned what it truly means to be a leader  and develop resilience. I went into the army as an Intelligence analyst. This  was a job I had no idea what it was or even what they did. I struggled a lot in  the schoolhouse. I really had to dig deep and study or else I would wash out  and then go back home as a failure. Over the next four years traveled all over  the place.  in some interesting situation  that allowed me to grow and develop into someone with some amazing skill and  life lesson that are still serving me to this day. It allowed me to grow and  really figure out what I do and do not want in life. Since then, I have been  figuring out the next steps which have led me to this point in my life. I have  decided to change careers and go back to school and learn about computers.  There are a couple of hobbies that are especially important to me. The first  one is working out. From a young age I have always been active and doing something.  As I got older and kept playing sports the gym quickly became one of those  hobbies and has stuck. At first it was all about just being big and fast for  sports but as I got older it became something I just enjoy doing. Then next  would be hiking. I enjoy being able to disconnect from the world every so  often. Too much in today&rsquo;s information world are people always looking at a  screen or on their phone. It has been nice to go out travel and see some  amazing places on my hikes. Most of have been right here in the state of North  Carolina.</p>
